<a name="Deep-Dive:-Smartcase-Engine-Architecture"></a>
<h2>Deep Dive: Smartcase Engine Architecture</h2>

<p>At the heart of Smartcase Engine is a clean, extensible <strong>microservices-based architecture</strong> designed to support complex workflows in case/dispute management scenarios. The system is broken into discrete services that communicate via REST APIs and Kafka for event-driven interactions. This modular approach allows teams to scale and evolve components independently.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the core services that power this engine:</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Intake-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Intake Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This is the gateway to the system — the service responsible for accepting new cases or disputes.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Receive new dispute cases via API or event (Kafka).</li>
<li>Validate and enrich the incoming payload.</li>
<li>Generate a unique dispute ID.</li>
<li>Store initial metadata and emit an event to kick off downstream workflow.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Built using Java + Quarkus for lightweight runtime.</li>
<li>Connects to Kafka for emitting intake-completed events.</li>
<li>Persists initial data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or any pluggable DB).</li>
<li>Implements REST endpoints for manual intake testing or system integration.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
This service ensures that all disputes entering the system are properly structured and immediately traceable — forming the root of all subsequent orchestration.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Workflow-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Workflow Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This is the <em>brain</em> of the engine, orchestrating the lifecycle of a dispute across multiple business stages.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define and manage the state machine (or BPMN-style flow) for a dispute.</li>
<li>Trigger actions based on status updates (e.g., escalate, resolve, pause).</li>
<li>Call external services when required (e.g., fetch additional metadata, update agent queue).</li>
<li>Track state transitions and support retries/failures.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses a stateless orchestration model.</li>
<li>Integration with Kafka allows event-driven step progression.</li>
<li>Could be integrated with BPMN engines (like Camunda or Flowable) for visual modeling.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
This is the system&rsquo;s core engine. It allows Smartcase to define complex, non-linear workflows without hardcoding logic into the intake or agent UI layers.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Classification-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Classification Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Adds intelligence to the process by classifying disputes into appropriate categories.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use business rules or ML models to assign dispute types (e.g., &ldquo;billing error&rdquo;, &ldquo;fraud&rdquo;, &ldquo;product defect&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Optionally flag high-risk or high-priority disputes.</li>
<li>Feed classification results back into the workflow service to route the case accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stateless classification service.</li>
<li>Integrates with a basic rule engine or external ML service (could be backed by Python/ONNX, or a local inference server).</li>
<li>Input: structured dispute metadata. Output: classification code or tag.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
Classification drives automation. By programmatically tagging and triaging disputes, Smartcase avoids human bottlenecks and supports intelligent queue assignment.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Agent-UI-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Agent UI Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The interface between human agents and the system.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Display dispute data and current status.</li>
<li>Allow agents to take actions (e.g., approve, reject, escalate).</li>
<li>Show workflow progression.</li>
<li>Track comments, attachments, and communication logs.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frontend (typically in React or Angular).</li>
<li>Backend proxy or BFF layer in Quarkus serving data via REST.</li>
<li>Authenticated access with role-based views (agent, supervisor, auditor).</li>
<li>Pagination, search, filters, and sort capabilities to handle large volumes.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
No matter how automated the backend is, disputes often need human judgment. This UI is purpose-built for efficiency and transparency in resolution workflows.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Common-Module-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Common Module</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: A shared library of core utilities and contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).</li>
<li>Common validation logic.</li>
<li>Central configuration definitions.</li>
<li>Shared Kafka event schema.</li>
<li>Error handling standards and API response models.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Packaged as a reusable JAR.</li>
<li>Imported by all services as a dependency.</li>
<li>Promotes DRY principles and API consistency.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
Microservices need to stay loosely coupled — but shared types and utilities must remain consistent. This module enforces a standard language across the ecosystem.</p>

<hr />
