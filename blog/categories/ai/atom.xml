        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subset, deep learning, have revolutionized numerous industries, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. Deep learning, an approach within AI, has garnered significant attention for its ability to process vast amounts of data and extract complex patterns. In this advanced tech article, we will delve into the core concepts and techniques of deep learning, exploring its architecture, training process, and real-world applications.</p>

<h5>The Basics of Deep Learning</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>Neural Networks: Deep learning relies on neural networks, inspired by the human brain&rsquo;s structure and functioning. Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, with each neuron performing a weighted computation and applying an activation function.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): DNNs are neural networks with multiple hidden layers, enabling them to learn hierarchical representations of data. These layers enable deep learning models to capture intricate patterns and relationships within complex datasets.</p></li>
</ul>


<h5>Deep Learning Architectures</h5>

<h6>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h6>

<p>CNNs are designed for image and video analysis. They employ convolutional layers to extract local features from the input, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification.</p>
