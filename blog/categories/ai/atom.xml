        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, has driven an unprecedented surge in energy demand due to the computational intensity of training and operating these systems. Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, has highlighted electricity as the primary limiter of AI growth, estimating that the U.S. will require an additional 92 gigawatts (GW) of power—equivalent to the output of 92 nuclear power plants—to sustain the AI revolution. This analysis explores the current energy consumption of major companies’ AI infrastructure, projects future energy needs through 2035, and examines how these demands will reshape the energy sector, drawing on available data from web sources and posts on X.</p>

<a name="Current-Energy-Consumption-by-Major-Companies"></a>
<h2>Current Energy Consumption by Major Companies</h2>

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Major tech companies, or “hyperscalers” (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, OpenAI), are the primary drivers of AI infrastructure energy demand, operating massive data centers for training and inference of AI models. Training a single state-of-the-art AI model, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, can consume 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity, equivalent to the annual energy use of 4,800 U.S. households. Inference (running AI models for user queries) is also energy-intensive, with a single ChatGPT query requiring approximately 2.9 watt-hours, nearly 10 times that of a Google search (0.3 watt-hours). Below is an overview of key players’ energy footprints based on available data:</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>By 2030</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Global Demand</strong>: The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global data center electricity demand to reach 945 TWh (slightly more than Japan’s current consumption), with AI-optimized data centers quadrupling in power needs.<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works"></a></li>
<li><strong>U.S. Demand</strong>: U.S. data centers are expected to account for nearly half of the growth in national electricity demand, rising from 3-4% of total power in 2023 to 11-12% by 2030. This could require an additional 50 GW of capacity, with investments exceeding $500 billion in data center infrastructure alone (excluding grid upgrades).<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/how-data-centers-and-the-energy-sector-can-sate-ais-hunger-for-power"></a></li>
<li><strong>Training Needs</strong>: By 2030, training a single large AI model could demand up to 8 GW, equivalent to eight nuclear reactors, if current scaling trends continue.<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3572-1.html"></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>By 2035</strong>:</p>

<h3>Strategies to Meet Demand</h3>

<p><img src="/images/2025/Screenshot%202025-07-26%20at%208.46.26%E2%80%AFPM.png" height="300" width="900" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy Investments</strong>: Companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are investing heavily in renewables. Microsoft’s 10.5 GW deal and Google’s $75 billion AI infrastructure budget signal a shift toward carbon-free energy, though intermittency remains a challenge.<a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/projecting-the-electricity-demand-growth-of-generative-ai-large-language-models-in-the-us/"></a><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"></a></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Power Revival</strong>: Hyperscalers are turning to nuclear energy for reliable, high-capacity power. Microsoft’s Three Mile Island deal and Meta’s exploration of nuclear options in Louisiana highlight this trend. Small modular reactors and geothermal energy are also being evaluated.<a href="https://energy.mit.edu/news/the-multi-faceted-challenge-of-powering-ai/"></a><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3572-1.html"></a></li>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: Innovations like Google’s 40% reduction in data center energy use through AI-driven cooling and more efficient chips (e.g., DeepSeek’s potential efficiency gains) could mitigate demand growth. Shared data centers and cloud computing can further reduce energy waste.<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/04/how-to-manage-ais-energy-demand-today-tomorrow-and-in-the-future/"></a></li>
<li><strong>Grid Flexibility</strong>: Duke University’s report suggests that existing U.S. grid “headroom” could support 100 GW of new data center capacity if consumption is managed during peak hours. This requires data centers to adopt flexible load scheduling.<a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/america-may-not-need-massive-energy-build-out-power-ai-revolution"></a></li>
</ul>


<a name="Economic-and-Social-Impacts"></a>
<h3>Economic and Social Impacts</h3>

<p><img src="/images/2025/Screenshot%202025-07-26%20at%208.46.38%E2%80%AFPM.png" height="300" width="900" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cost Increases</strong>: The $500 billion+ investment in data center infrastructure could lead to higher electricity bills for consumers, as utilities pass on grid upgrade costs. Meta’s Louisiana project, for instance, may raise rates after 15 years if gas turbines remain in use.<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116272/ai-natural-gas-data-centers-energy-power-plants/"></a></li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Implications</strong>: If U.S. energy constraints persist, companies may build data centers abroad (e.g., Malaysia), risking national security and AI leadership. Schmidt’s emphasis on energy as a bottleneck underscores the need for domestic investment to maintain competitiveness.<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3572-1.html"></a></li>
<li><strong>Environmental Concerns</strong>: AI’s energy demands could double data center carbon emissions by 2030, with a “social cost” of $125-140 billion unless mitigated by renewables or nuclear power. Natural gas plants, planned to meet immediate needs, could lock in emissions for decades.<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030"></a><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116272/ai-natural-gas-data-centers-energy-power-plants/"></a></li>
</ul>


<a name="Policy-and-Innovation-Needs"></a>
<h3>Policy and Innovation Needs</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Government Action</strong>: President Biden’s Executive Order (January 2025) aims to accelerate AI infrastructure development by leasing federal lands for gigawatt-scale data centers powered by clean energy. The Defense Production Act could address energy shortfalls.<a href="https://rpower1.com/articles/the-power-of-ai-building-the-energy-infrastructure-for-americas-ai-revolution/"></a></li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Upgrades</strong>: Over $800 billion in transmission and distribution investments are needed in Europe alone, with similar needs in the U.S. to support AI growth.<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand"></a></li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Researchers and the IEA call for greater transparency from AI companies on energy consumption to improve planning and mitigate environmental impacts.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00616-z"></a><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works"></a></li>
</ul>


<a name="Critical-Analysis"></a>
<h2>Critical Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schmidt’s 92 GW Estimate</strong>: While ambitious, Schmidt’s projection aligns with estimates like RAND’s 68 GW by 2027 and Goldman Sachs’ 100 GW by 2030, though it assumes aggressive AI adoption. Duke University’s claim of existing grid capacity suggests this demand could be met without massive new infrastructure, but only with significant flexibility in data center operations.<a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/america-may-not-need-massive-energy-build-out-power-ai-revolution"></a><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3572-1.html"></a><a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030"></a></li>
<li><strong>Uncertainties</strong>: Estimates vary widely due to unpredictable AI efficiency gains (e.g., DeepSeek’s potential), adoption rates, and infrastructure development timelines. Overbuilding natural gas plants risks stranded assets if AI demand slows.<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116272/ai-natural-gas-data-centers-energy-power-plants/"></a></li>
<li><strong>Environmental Trade-offs</strong>: The reliance on natural gas to meet immediate needs conflicts with zero-carbon goals, potentially locking in emissions for decades. Nuclear and renewable solutions are promising but face scalability and cost challenges.<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116272/ai-natural-gas-data-centers-energy-power-plants/"></a><a href="https://energy.mit.edu/news/the-multi-faceted-challenge-of-powering-ai/"></a></li>
<li><strong>Data Gaps</strong>: Lack of transparency from companies like OpenAI hinders accurate forecasting. More granular data on training and inference energy use is needed to refine projections.<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"></a></li>
</ul>


<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The AI revolution, driven by hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI, is pushing energy demands to unprecedented levels, with current U.S. data center consumption at 4.4% of national electricity and projected to reach 11-12% by 2030. Schmidt’s estimate of an additional 92 GW by 2035 underscores the scale of the challenge, requiring investments in renewables, nuclear power, and grid upgrades. While innovations in efficiency and flexible grid management offer hope, the risk of cost increases, environmental impacts, and geopolitical shifts looms large. To maintain AI leadership and sustainability, the U.S. must prioritize energy infrastructure development, transparency, and strategic policy interventions to balance growth with environmental and economic stability.</p>

        <id>https://rishijeet.github.io/blog/from-text-to-tokens-the-complete-guide-to-tokenization-in-llms</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and LLaMA have reshaped how machines understand and generate human language. Behind the impressive capabilities of these models lies a deceptively simple but foundational step: <strong>tokenization</strong>.</p>

<p>In this blog, we will dive deep into the concept of tokenization, understand its types, why it&rsquo;s needed, the challenges it solves, how it works under the hood, and where it’s headed in the future. This is a one-stop technical deep-dive for anyone looking to fully grasp the backbone of language understanding in LLMs.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-What-is-Tokenization-3f--3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>What is Tokenization?</strong></h2>

<p>At its core, tokenization is the process of converting raw text into smaller units called <strong>tokens</strong> that a language model can understand and process. These tokens can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Characters</li>
<li>Words</li>
<li>Subwords</li>
<li>Byte-pair sequences</li>
<li>WordPieces</li>
<li>SentencePieces</li>
<li>Byte-level representations</li>
</ul>


<p>Each model has its own strategy, depending on design goals like efficiency, vocabulary size, multilingual handling, and memory constraints.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For example, the sentence:</p>

<pre><code>"Tokenization is crucial for LLMs."
</code></pre>

<p>May be tokenized as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Word-level: <code>["Tokenization", "is", "crucial", "for", "LLMs", "."]</code></li>
<li>Character-level: <code>["T", "o", "k", ..., "L", "L", "M", "s", "."]</code></li>
<li>Subword (BPE): <code>["Token", "ization", "is", "cru", "cial", "for", "LL", "Ms", "."]</code></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Why-Tokenization-is-Needed-in-LLMs-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>Why Tokenization is Needed in LLMs</strong></h2>

<p>Language models operate over numbers (tensors), not raw strings. Before any neural network processes your prompt, the words must be:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Split into atomic units (tokens)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mapped to numerical IDs (vocabulary embedding)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fed into the model as vectors</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Without tokenization:</p>

<ul>
<li>Models would struggle with infinite vocabulary.</li>
<li>Multilingual text and compound words would explode the vocabulary.</li>
<li>There would be no efficient way to control sequence length or positional encoding.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Types-of-Tokenization-Strategies-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>Types of Tokenization Strategies</strong></h2>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Word-2d-Level-Tokenization-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Word-Level Tokenization</strong></h3>

<p>Each word is a token. Simple but inefficient for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unknown words (out-of-vocabulary issues)</li>
<li>Morphologically rich languages</li>
<li>Compound words</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Example:</strong>
&ldquo;unhappiness&rdquo; → 1 token → [“unhappiness”]
If unseen during training, this is a problem.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Character-2d-Level-Tokenization-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Character-Level Tokenization</strong></h3>

<p>Each character is a token. Solves OOV issues but leads to longer sequences and loss of semantic granularity.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>
&ldquo;unhappiness&rdquo; → [“u”, “n”, “h”, “a”, “p”, …]</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Subword-Tokenization-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Subword Tokenization</strong></h3>

<p>Breaks words into frequent subword units using statistical techniques like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)</strong> – used by GPT-2, GPT-3</li>
<li><strong>WordPiece</strong> – used by BERT</li>
<li><strong>Unigram Language Model</strong> – used by SentencePiece (T5, LLaMA)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Example (BPE):</strong>
&ldquo;unhappiness&rdquo; → [“un”, “happi”, “ness”]</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Handles unknown words gracefully</li>
<li>Reduces vocabulary size</li>
<li>Efficient for multilingual models</li>
</ul>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Byte-2d-Level-Tokenization-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Byte-Level Tokenization</strong></h3>

<p>Tokenizes text at the byte level, including UTF-8 encodings.</p>

<p>Used by models like GPT-3.5/4 to handle raw binary inputs and emojis robustly.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>
“🔥” → byte sequence → [240, 159, 148, 165]</p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-SentencePiece-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>SentencePiece</strong></h3>

<p>A library that trains subword models using BPE or Unigram LM on raw text. Used in multilingual LLMs like T5, mT5.</p>

<p>It allows training on raw text without pre-tokenization (no need for whitespace-based splitting).</p>

<h2><strong>How Tokenization Works: Under the Hood</strong></h2>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Training-a-Tokenizer-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Training a Tokenizer</strong></h3>

<p>During tokenizer training, the process involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading a large corpus</li>
<li>Building frequency tables of substrings</li>
<li>Iteratively merging the most frequent substrings</li>
<li>Forming a vocabulary of tokens</li>
<li>Saving a tokenizer model (vocab + merge rules)</li>
</ul>


<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Encoding-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Encoding</strong></h3>

<p>At inference or training:</p>

<ul>
<li>Input string → split into substrings based on learned merges</li>
<li>Tokens → mapped to numerical IDs via the vocabulary</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="python">from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("Tokenization is powerful.")
print(tokens)
# Output: ['Token', 'ization', 'Ġis', 'Ġpowerful', '.']
</code></pre>

<p><code>Ġ</code> indicates a space in GPT-2 tokenizers.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Tokenization-and-Model-Limits-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>Tokenization and Model Limits</strong></h2>

<p>Most LLMs have a context window defined in <strong>tokens</strong>, not characters. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>GPT-3.5: 4,096 tokens</li>
<li>GPT-4 (o4): 128,000 tokens</li>
<li>Claude 3 Opus: \~200,000 tokens</li>
</ul>


<p>So, 1000 words of English ≈ 750 tokens.</p>

<p>This is crucial for prompt design, summarization, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and efficient inference.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>Tokenization may appear trivial at first glance, but it&rsquo;s the hidden workhorse powering the language capabilities of every modern LLM. From enabling multilingual understanding to compressing long documents into tight prompts, tokenization determines what the model sees, learns, and generates.</p>

<p>As we step into an era of 1M+ token context windows, modality fusion, and instruction-following agents, tokenization will either evolve or be replaced by more fluid, learned representations.</p>

<p>But for now—and the foreseeable future—it remains a vital piece of the LLM puzzle.</p>

<a name="Deep-Dive:-Smartcase-Engine-Architecture"></a>
<h2>Deep Dive: Smartcase Engine Architecture</h2>

<p>At the heart of Smartcase Engine is a clean, extensible <strong>microservices-based architecture</strong> designed to support complex workflows in case/dispute management scenarios. The system is broken into discrete services that communicate via REST APIs and Kafka for event-driven interactions. This modular approach allows teams to scale and evolve components independently.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the core services that power this engine:</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Intake-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Intake Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This is the gateway to the system — the service responsible for accepting new cases or disputes.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Receive new dispute cases via API or event (Kafka).</li>
<li>Validate and enrich the incoming payload.</li>
<li>Generate a unique dispute ID.</li>
<li>Store initial metadata and emit an event to kick off downstream workflow.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Built using Java + Quarkus for lightweight runtime.</li>
<li>Connects to Kafka for emitting intake-completed events.</li>
<li>Persists initial data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or any pluggable DB).</li>
<li>Implements REST endpoints for manual intake testing or system integration.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
This service ensures that all disputes entering the system are properly structured and immediately traceable — forming the root of all subsequent orchestration.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Workflow-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Workflow Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This is the <em>brain</em> of the engine, orchestrating the lifecycle of a dispute across multiple business stages.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define and manage the state machine (or BPMN-style flow) for a dispute.</li>
<li>Trigger actions based on status updates (e.g., escalate, resolve, pause).</li>
<li>Call external services when required (e.g., fetch additional metadata, update agent queue).</li>
<li>Track state transitions and support retries/failures.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses a stateless orchestration model.</li>
<li>Integration with Kafka allows event-driven step progression.</li>
<li>Could be integrated with BPMN engines (like Camunda or Flowable) for visual modeling.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
This is the system&rsquo;s core engine. It allows Smartcase to define complex, non-linear workflows without hardcoding logic into the intake or agent UI layers.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Classification-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Classification Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Adds intelligence to the process by classifying disputes into appropriate categories.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use business rules or ML models to assign dispute types (e.g., &ldquo;billing error&rdquo;, &ldquo;fraud&rdquo;, &ldquo;product defect&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Optionally flag high-risk or high-priority disputes.</li>
<li>Feed classification results back into the workflow service to route the case accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stateless classification service.</li>
<li>Integrates with a basic rule engine or external ML service (could be backed by Python/ONNX, or a local inference server).</li>
<li>Input: structured dispute metadata. Output: classification code or tag.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
Classification drives automation. By programmatically tagging and triaging disputes, Smartcase avoids human bottlenecks and supports intelligent queue assignment.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Agent-UI-Service-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Agent UI Service</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The interface between human agents and the system.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Display dispute data and current status.</li>
<li>Allow agents to take actions (e.g., approve, reject, escalate).</li>
<li>Show workflow progression.</li>
<li>Track comments, attachments, and communication logs.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frontend (typically in React or Angular).</li>
<li>Backend proxy or BFF layer in Quarkus serving data via REST.</li>
<li>Authenticated access with role-based views (agent, supervisor, auditor).</li>
<li>Pagination, search, filters, and sort capabilities to handle large volumes.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
No matter how automated the backend is, disputes often need human judgment. This UI is purpose-built for efficiency and transparency in resolution workflows.</p>

<hr />

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Dispute-Common-Module-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Dispute Common Module</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: A shared library of core utilities and contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).</li>
<li>Common validation logic.</li>
<li>Central configuration definitions.</li>
<li>Shared Kafka event schema.</li>
<li>Error handling standards and API response models.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Packaged as a reusable JAR.</li>
<li>Imported by all services as a dependency.</li>
<li>Promotes DRY principles and API consistency.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:
Microservices need to stay loosely coupled — but shared types and utilities must remain consistent. This module enforces a standard language across the ecosystem.</p>

<hr />

<a name="Optional-Add-2d-ons--28-Future-Ready-29-"></a>
<h3>Optional Add-ons (Future Ready)</h3>

<p>Depending on your scale and use case, Smartcase Engine can be extended with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Notification Service</strong>: For sending SMS/email alerts to users or agents.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logging</strong>: For compliance with financial or legal audits.</li>
<li><strong>Retry/Dead-letter Queue Mechanism</strong>: To gracefully handle transient failures.</li>
<li><strong>Observability Tools</strong>: Integrated with Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.</li>
