        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The London Whale trading scandal was one of the largest trading losses in financial history, involving JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. It was caused by high-risk trading activities within the bank&rsquo;s Chief Investment Office (CIO), resulting in <strong>$6.2 billion in losses</strong>. The scandal led to regulatory fines, reputational damage, and increased scrutiny of JPMorgan&rsquo;s risk management practices.</p>

<h2><strong>The Trading Strategy</strong></h2>

<p>The CIO was originally responsible for investing excess deposits in relatively safe assets. However, it began engaging in riskier trades using synthetic credit derivatives, specifically <strong>credit default swaps (CDS)</strong>, which are financial instruments used to hedge credit risk.</p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-How-the-Trades-Went-Wrong-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>How the Trades Went Wrong</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Massive CDS Positions</strong>: The CIO built an enormous position in a specific CDS index (CDX.NA.IG.9), betting that credit markets would remain stable.</li>
<li><strong>Market Distortion</strong>: The sheer size of these trades (up to <strong>$157 billion</strong> in notional value) distorted the market, drawing attention from hedge funds and traders.</li>
<li><strong>Mounting Losses</strong>: As market conditions changed, the position moved against JPMorgan, leading to billions in paper losses.</li>
<li><strong>Attempts to Hide Losses</strong>: Internal emails and messages suggest that traders attempted to delay recognizing losses, allegedly misrepresenting valuations to minimize reported losses.</li>
</ol>
