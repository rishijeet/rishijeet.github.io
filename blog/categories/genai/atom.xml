<a name="Strategic-Investments-in-Computing-Power"></a>
<h2>Strategic Investments in Computing Power</h2>

<p>Anticipating the critical role of computational resources in AI advancement, Liang Wenfeng initiated substantial investments in high-performance hardware. Between 2020 and 2021, High-Flyer constructed two AI supercomputing clusters comprising Nvidia&rsquo;s A100 graphics processing units (GPUs). The first cluster, operational in 2020, integrated 1,100 A100 chips at a cost of 200 million yuan.
The subsequent year saw the completion of a second, more expansive cluster with approximately 10,000 A100 chips, representing a 1 billion yuan investment. These strategic acquisitions occurred prior to the U.S. government&rsquo;s 2022 restrictions on exporting advanced chips to China, positioning High-Flyer advantageously amid tightening technological embargoes.</p>
