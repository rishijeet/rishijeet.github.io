        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the AI landscape rapidly evolves, the demand for systems that support <strong>modular</strong>, <strong>context-aware</strong>, and <strong>efficient orchestration</strong> of models has grown. Enter the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> — a rising standard that enables dynamic, multi-agent AI systems to exchange context, manage state, and chain model invocations intelligently.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll explore what MCP is, why it matters, and how it’s becoming a key component in the infrastructure stack for advanced AI applications. We’ll also walk through a conceptual example of building an MCP-compatible server.</p>

<a name="What-is-the-Model-Context-Protocol--28-MCP-29--3f-"></a>
<h2>What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?</h2>

<p><strong>MCP</strong> is a protocol designed to manage the <strong>contextual state</strong> of AI models across requests in multi-agent, multi-model environments. It’s part of a broader effort to make LLMs (Large Language Models) more <strong>stateful</strong>, <strong>collaborative</strong>, and <strong>task-aware</strong>.</p>

<p>At its core, MCP provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>A way to <strong>pass and maintain context</strong> (like conversation history, task progress, or shared knowledge) across AI agents or model calls.</li>
<li>A standardized protocol to support <strong>chained inference</strong>, where multiple models collaborate on subtasks.</li>
<li>Support for <strong>stateful computation</strong>, which is critical in complex reasoning or long-running workflows.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Core-Concepts-of-MCP"></a>
<h2>Core Concepts of MCP</h2>

<p>An MCP server typically supports the following concepts:</p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Model-Context-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Model Context</strong></h3>

<pre><code class="json">{
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "user_id": "user-456",
  "context": {
    "history": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Generate a project plan." },
      { "role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's a draft..." }
    ],
    "task": "project_planning",
    "dependencies": ["retrieval_plugin", "summarizer_model"]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Model-Invocation-with-Context-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Model Invocation with Context</strong></h3>

<pre><code class="json">{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "input": "What are the next steps?",
  "context_ref": "abc-123",
  "metadata": {
    "requested_capability": "planning.summarize"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Chained-Outputs-and-Shared-State-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Chained Outputs and Shared State</strong></h3>

<p>Each model contributes to a shared state, stored either in an in-memory store (like Redis) or a structured store (like Postgres + pgvector for embeddings).</p>

<a name="Building-a-Basic-MCP-Server"></a>
<h2>Building a Basic MCP Server</h2>

<p>Let’s outline what a minimal MCP-compatible server might look like using <strong>FastAPI</strong> and <strong>Redis</strong>.</p>

<a name="Basic-Server-with-Context-Store"></a>
<h3>Basic Server with Context Store</h3>

<pre><code class="python">from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import redis
import uuid
import json

app = FastAPI()
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

@app.post("/invoke")
async def invoke_model(request: Request):
    payload = await request.json()
    context_ref = payload.get("context_ref")
    input_text = payload["input"]
    model = payload["model"]

    # Load context
    context = json.loads(r.get(context_ref)) if context_ref else {}
    history = context.get("history", [])

    # Simulate model response
    history.append({"role": "user", "content": input_text})
    response = f"Simulated response to: {input_text}"
    history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})

    # Save updated context
    new_context_ref = context_ref or str(uuid.uuid4())
    r.set(new_context_ref, json.dumps({"history": history}))

    return {"output": response, "context_ref": new_context_ref}
</code></pre>

<a name="Add-Capability-Metadata"></a>
<h3>Add Capability Metadata</h3>

<p>Enhance the server to log requested capabilities and dependency resolution (e.g., invoking tools or submodels).</p>

<pre><code class="python">capability = payload.get("metadata", {}).get("requested_capability")
log_event(user_id, session_id, model, capability)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<a name="MCP-vs-Alternatives"></a>
<h2>MCP vs Alternatives</h2>

<p>MCP aims to serve as the <strong>underlying protocol</strong>, while frameworks like LangChain act as <strong>developer tooling on top</strong>.</p>
