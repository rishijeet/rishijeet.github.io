        <link href="https://rishijeet.github.io/blog/case-study-the-collapse-of-silicon-valley-bank/"/>
        <updated>2025-03-09T11:48:11+05:30</updated>
        <id>https://rishijeet.github.io/blog/case-study-the-collapse-of-silicon-valley-bank</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was one of the largest banks catering to the startup and venture capital ecosystem in the United States. Its sudden collapse in March 2023 sent shockwaves through the financial sector, prompting government intervention and raising concerns about the stability of other regional banks. This case study explores the factors that led to SVB&rsquo;s failure, its impact, and key lessons learned.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2025/svb.webp" height="300" width="900" alt="Alt text" /><em>Source: Internet</em></p>

<a name="Background-of-Silicon-Valley-Bank"></a>
<h2>Background of Silicon Valley Bank</h2>

<p>Founded in 1983, SVB grew into the 16th largest bank in the U.S., with assets exceeding $209 billion by the end of 2022. It specialized in serving technology startups, venture capital (VC) firms, and innovation-driven companies. SVB&rsquo;s business model relied heavily on deposit funding from these clients and investments in long-duration U.S. government bonds.</p>

<!--more-->


<a name="Growth-and-Success"></a>
<h3>Growth and Success</h3>

<ul>
<li>By 2021, SVB’s total assets grew by 215% compared to 2019.</li>
<li>It controlled nearly <strong>50% of all venture-backed startups’ deposits</strong> in the U.S.</li>
<li>A key player in the tech boom, SVB benefited from rising valuations, strong venture funding, and low interest rates.</li>
</ul>


<a name="The-Downfall:-Key-Factors-Leading-to-the-Collapse"></a>
<h2>The Downfall: Key Factors Leading to the Collapse</h2>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Overreliance-on-Long-2d-Term-Bonds-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Overreliance on Long-Term Bonds</strong></h3>

<p>SVB invested heavily in long-term U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to generate returns. However, these investments carried significant interest rate risk.</p>

<ul>
<li>By 2022, nearly <strong>57% of SVB’s total assets ($120 billion)</strong> were invested in securities, primarily long-duration bonds.</li>
<li>When interest rates rise, bond values fall, creating unrealized losses.</li>
</ul>


<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Federal-Reserve-e2--80--99-s-Interest-Rate-Hikes-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Federal Reserve’s Interest Rate Hikes</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>The Federal Reserve raised interest rates <strong>11 times from March 2022 to March 2023</strong>, increasing the federal funds rate from <strong>0.25% to 4.75%</strong>.</li>
<li>The sharp rise in rates led to a <strong>$17 billion unrealized loss</strong> on SVB’s bond portfolio.</li>
<li>This devalued SVB’s assets, making it more vulnerable to liquidity pressures.</li>
</ul>


<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Tech-Industry-Slowdown-and-Deposit-Flight-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Tech Industry Slowdown and Deposit Flight</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>As interest rates rose, venture capital funding declined <strong>by 31% in 2022</strong>, leading startups to withdraw deposits.</li>
<li>SVB’s deposits dropped from <strong>$198 billion in March 2022 to $165 billion by the end of 2022</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Panic-and-Bank-Run--28-March-2023-29--3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Panic and Bank Run (March 2023)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>On <strong>March 8, 2023</strong>, SVB announced it had sold $21 billion worth of securities at a <strong>$1.8 billion loss</strong> and planned to raise $2.25 billion in new capital.</li>
<li>This triggered panic among VC firms and startups, leading to mass withdrawals of <strong>$42 billion in a single day</strong> (March 9).</li>
<li>On <strong>March 10, 2023</strong>, regulators shut down SVB, marking the <strong>largest U.S. bank failure since 2008</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Government-and-Market-Response"></a>
<h2>Government and Market Response</h2>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-FDIC-Intervention-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>FDIC Intervention</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</strong> took control of SVB, ensuring deposits up to <strong>$250,000</strong>.</li>
<li>On <strong>March 12, 2023</strong>, the U.S. government guaranteed all deposits, preventing wider contagion.</li>
</ul>


<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Stock-Market-and-Banking-Sector-Impact-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Stock Market and Banking Sector Impact</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Bank stocks plummeted, with <strong>First Republic Bank losing 70%</strong> of its value within days.</li>
<li>The <strong>KBW Bank Index</strong> (measuring U.S. bank performance) dropped <strong>18% in March 2023</strong>.</li>
<li>Global financial markets reacted sharply, fearing systemic risks.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/2025/svb_stock.avif" height="300" width="900" alt="Alt text" /><em>Source: Internet</em></p>

<a name="Key-Lessons-and-Takeaways"></a>
<h2>Key Lessons and Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Risk of Asset-Liability Mismatch</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SVB’s heavy reliance on long-duration bonds while serving short-term depositors created a major mismatch, exposing
it to liquidity risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interest Rate Sensitivity in Banking</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Banks must proactively hedge against interest rate fluctuations, especially in a rising-rate environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Power of Panic and Social Media</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SVB’s collapse was exacerbated by rapid digital bank runs, fueled by panic-driven withdrawals coordinated through
social media and VC networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory and Risk Management Gaps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SVB was exempt from <strong>Dodd-Frank stress testing</strong> due to relaxed regulations in 2018.</li>
<li>Stricter oversight on regional banks could have mitigated risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank exposed vulnerabilities in the financial system, particularly for banks with concentrated deposit bases and interest rate exposure. While the FDIC’s intervention prevented a broader crisis, the incident underscored the need for robust risk management, diversified banking strategies, and stronger regulatory frameworks. SVB’s downfall serves as a cautionary tale for financial institutions navigating uncertain economic conditions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Prologue:-The-Illusion-of-Prosperity-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Prologue: The Illusion of Prosperity</strong></h3>

<p>In the early 2000s, the United States and much of the Western world were riding high on a wave of economic prosperity. The stock market was booming, home prices were soaring, and credit was available to almost anyone who wanted it. The American Dream had never seemed more attainable. But beneath the surface, cracks were forming in the foundations of this seemingly unstoppable growth.</p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Act-1:-The-Bubble-Inflates--28-2000-2d-2006-29--3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h3><strong>Act 1: The Bubble Inflates (2000-2006)</strong></h3>

<p>The origins of the Great Recession can be traced back to a combination of financial deregulation, a booming housing market, and risky lending practices.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Role of Subprime Mortgages:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Banks and financial institutions, encouraged by deregulation, began issuing high-risk loans to borrowers with poor credit histories.</li>
<li>The subprime mortgage market grew from <strong>8% of total mortgage originations in 2001 to over 20% by 2006</strong>.</li>
<li>Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) turned these risky loans into attractive investments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/2025/subprime.png" height="300" width="900" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Role of the Federal Reserve:</strong>

<ul>
<li>In response to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates from <strong>6.5% in 2000 to 1% by 2003</strong>.</li>
<li>Cheap credit fueled an artificial boom in housing, encouraging speculative investments.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Epilogue: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead</strong></h3>

<p>The Great Recession reshaped the global financial landscape. It exposed the dangers of excessive risk-taking, inadequate regulation, and blind faith in financial engineering.</p>

<p>Lesser-known facts:</p>

<li>Lehman Brothers’ failure was partially due to a refusal from Barclays and the UK government to intervene.</li>
<li>At the height of the crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve secretly loaned over $16 trillion to global banks to prevent a total collapse.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett described the financial derivatives market as &ldquo;financial weapons of mass destruction&rdquo; years before the crisis hit.</li>
</ul>


<p>While economies have largely recovered, new risks such as corporate debt bubbles and geopolitical tensions continue to pose challenges. The Great Recession serves as a stark reminder that financial stability is never guaranteed.</p>

        <id>https://rishijeet.github.io/blog/case-study-lipton-a-global-tea-powerhouse</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the bustling streets of Glasgow, Scotland, in the 1870s, a young, ambitious entrepreneur named Sir Thomas Lipton had a vision—to make tea, once a luxury for the elite, accessible to everyone. Little did he know that his dream would evolve into a global tea empire that would redefine the industry for generations to come.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2025/lipton_logo.png" height="300" width="900" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-The-Humble-Beginnings-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>The Humble Beginnings</strong></h2>

<p>Thomas Lipton, born in 1848 to Irish immigrant parents, was no stranger to hard work. At the age of 15, he sailed to the United States, where he took up various jobs, including working in a grocery store. Observing the efficiency of American retail operations, he returned to Scotland with a dream of revolutionizing the food trade.</p>

<p>In 1871, at the age of 23, Lipton opened his first grocery store in Glasgow. He marketed his store as offering “the best goods at the cheapest prices,” a philosophy that won the hearts of working-class families. His business grew rapidly, and by the 1880s, he owned over 300 stores across Britain. But Lipton was always thinking bigger.</p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Breaking-Into-the-Tea-Industry-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>Breaking Into the Tea Industry</strong></h2>

<p>During the late 19th century, tea was an expensive luxury, controlled by middlemen who inflated prices. Lipton saw an opportunity. Rather than relying on suppliers, he decided to cut out the middlemen and source tea directly from plantations in Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka). He bought vast tea estates, ensuring quality control and reducing costs.</p>

<p>To market his tea, Lipton leveraged his exceptional promotional skills. He sponsored hot air balloon events, used colorful advertisements, and even hired elephants to parade through London’s streets carrying Lipton Tea chests. His genius lay in making tea not just affordable but desirable.</p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Tea-for-the-Masses-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>Tea for the Masses</strong></h2>

<p>Lipton introduced the concept of pre-packaged tea, a revolutionary idea at the time. Until then, tea was sold loose, and quality varied. By branding and packaging his tea, he guaranteed consistency, making it more appealing to customers. His slogan, “Direct from the Tea Gardens to the Teapot,” became synonymous with freshness and affordability.</p>

<p>By 1890, Lipton Tea was a household name in Britain, and soon, it spread across Europe and America. He even earned a royal warrant as the official tea supplier to Queen Victoria—a remarkable feat for a man who started with a single grocery store.</p>

<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-Global-Expansion-and-Innovations-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>Global Expansion and Innovations</strong></h2>

<p>In the early 20th century, Lipton continued expanding, setting up distribution channels worldwide. One of the most significant milestones came in the 1950s when Lipton became part of the Unilever conglomerate, giving it access to unparalleled resources and global reach.</p>

<p>As consumer habits evolved, Lipton adapted. The introduction of tea bags in the 1950s and ready-to-drink iced tea in the 1990s revolutionized the industry. Lipton embraced health-conscious trends, launching green teas, herbal infusions, and organic blends.</p>

<h2><strong>Fun Facts and Data Points</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lipton Today</strong>: Sold in over <strong>110 countries</strong>, Lipton is one of the world’s most recognizable tea brands.</li>
<li><strong>Tea Production</strong>: Lipton sources tea from <strong>more than 600 tea estates</strong> worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Commitment</strong>: Lipton has committed to <strong>100% Rainforest Alliance Certified tea</strong>, ensuring sustainable farming practices.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing Genius</strong>: In 1929, Lipton launched one of the first-ever radio commercials in America, setting the stage for modern advertising strategies.</li>
</ul>


<a name="L-3c-strong-3e-The-Legacy-of-Lipton-3c--2f-strong-3e-"></a>
<h2><strong>The Legacy of Lipton</strong></h2>

<p>From a single grocery store in Glasgow to a global powerhouse, Lipton’s journey is a testament to innovation, persistence, and an unyielding belief in making quality tea accessible to all. Sir Thomas Lipton’s legacy endures not just in every cup of Lipton tea enjoyed worldwide but in the very fabric of modern retail and branding strategies.</p>

<p>So, the next time you sip on a warm cup of Lipton tea, remember—you’re not just drinking tea; you’re tasting a rich history steeped in vision and ingenuity.</p>
